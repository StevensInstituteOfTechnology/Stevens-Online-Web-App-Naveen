One is the foundations of management: things like project management, financial management — the skills you need to manage any problem or project. The second is data.

At the School of Systems & Enterprises, we address problems through a lens of complexity. If you build an engine or an aircraft or an information system, those are complex environments.

You need to have a scope for the measurement. Why are you measuring the size of, let’s say, a screen in a car?

I generally answer with an example from the movie industry. When you are a director of a traditional Hollywood movie, you need management skills because it’s a complex environment. There are a lot of parts: financial aspects, different personalities to manage, deadlines to meet. These are skills you can learn in an MBA program.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Now, if you are directing a Pixar movie, you need different skills, and some of them have to be technology-related because technology is an essential component.

You need traditional management skills — budgeting, people management, all of that — but on top of that, there’s a technical component you don’t need for live-action movies.

I think AI and machine learning are changing very rapidly. I was fortunate to start my career working in AI machine learning. In 1986, I was with an information technology group in Europe that worked closely with MIT. My company was developing natural language processing and also expert/knowledge-based systems. My field was knowledge-based systems, which have changed dramatically over time.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"These changes stem from two causes. First, we have better computing now: more powerful processors, larger storage capacity, and better software. The systems I used then are long obsolete; they were quite low-level compared to what we have now. We didn’t have libraries to draw from when we wrote algorithms. We had to write it from the tiniest portion on up. Writing algorithms is still a lot of work, but now you can focus more of that effort at a higher level.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The second cause is the availability of data. We never had it before, and now we have so much. No matter how intelligent a system is, it’s still data-driven. If you don’t have data, you can’t do forecasts. Take a facial recognition algorithm, for example. You may have the most brilliant algorithm, but it won’t recognize faces without a sufficient number of cases. You need the data. That’s why countries like China and cities like London have higher success rates in recognizing faces: they have more extensive data sets.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The combination of the two — computing power and data — that’s what’s driving progress. Everything we do now in our daily lives is digitally coded with TCP IP, the same protocol we use for the internet. That’s the game-changer in AI.

Let me offer an example from my career. I worked at Bell Labs for 25 years. The first project I led developed a processor from scratch. It took four to five years to complete the project. I had to learn the nuts and bolts, from the properties of silicon all the way to the logic of creating a processor that’s fault-tolerant and real-time and meets the requirement of no more than three minutes of downtime per year. How do you create the hardware and software to do that? These are the kinds of problems you can solve as a computer scientist. In the end, it cost Bell Labs $1.8 billion to develop and deploy that processor. It’s still running in the AT&T network, many years later.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Later, I moved into software development. I developed software for mobile systems and provisioning systems. At that point, I started to miss teaching — I am an educator. Friends told me there was a great opportunity at Stevens, so I joined. At this point, I’ve taught most of the courses in the program.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"heading","level":2,"text":"YOU’VE BEEN TEACHING ONLINE FOR YEARS. HOW HAS ONLINE COMPUTER SCIENCE INSTRUCTION CHANGED?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Years ago, we used to post content online and students would go read it. We didn’t really interact with students that much unless they came to office hours. But it’s evolved, and now there’s quite a bit of facetime — an hour and a half each week in each course. Teleconferencing apps make that possible. To me, there’s no difference between sitting in a live classroom and sitting on Zoom. I get to know students, I answer their questions in class and in meetings. Students are involved in a very interactive way even though they are not physically sitting in front of us.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Breakout rooms make it easy for them to collaborate and then share their group’s solution to a problem or ask questions. I usually pose a problem and then talk about it, and then students go into breakout rooms of three to five people and develop the answer together. We then discuss the solution from two or three of the breakout groups, which I choose at random. It makes the session much more lively than it would be if I just stood in front of the class and showed graphs and lectured.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"As we understand online learning better, we’ve developed content designed to work in an online format. We try to do as much interactive content as possible, and online textbooks are becoming more interactive as well. It’s not just reading and memorizing. It’s practice. The textbooks include participation activities, in which students answer questions as they read. It reinforces what they learn and it’s low stakes; you keep answering until you get the correct answer. Then there are challenge activities, in which students get graded on whether they answer correctly. Students like this format, and we’ve found it’s very effective in preparing them for the live sessions.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"heading","level":2,"text":"TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE FORMAT OF THE ONLINE MSCS PROGRAM."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"When possible, we use videos to teach concepts. In my algorithms class, for example, we’ve created a series of original, professionally produced videos teaching about algorithms inspired by nature. Whether it’s from ants or a cuckoo bird, nature can teach us how to solve some algorithm problems. Students get a new perspective. They see it’s not just stacks and queues.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"One set of videos approaches the elevator algorithm from different angles. Students have to figure out: What are we trying to optimize? Are we trying to save energy? Get people to the floor they want to get to as fast as possible? Should it be first-come, first-served, or should we factor in the direction of the elevator? It’s a complex problem. You have to look at the pattern of movement of people, not just who is going where but how many people are waiting on each floor, and at what time. In the morning, there’s a lot of traffic from the lobby to offices. At noon, there’s a lot of traffic to and from the cafeteria. The algorithm has to become a learning machine, so now this lesson in algorithms also becomes a lesson in the importance of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It turns out this problem is NP-complete, so it’s not solvable in the way we might want to solve it. But we can solve it by learning from ants, looking at how they find food and bring it to their nest — which brings us back to learning from nature. The videos teach all this, tie it all together in an engaging and memorable way.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"We tackle a lot of interesting problems in algorithms: how to match medical students to medical schools to optimize for both students and schools, how to create mazes, how to connect people on social networks.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"We are in a new era. We used to try to solve problems for computers, but we’re past that. Modern computers are fast; we don’t need to worry about optimizing them further. People keep talking about big O notation, and yes, it’s important to make things more efficient, but the big goal of algorithms is to make our lives easier — problem-solving for human satisfaction. People sometimes worry that computers will take over, but they don’t need to be afraid of that. If we program them the way we want, they will do the things we want.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"heading","level":2,"text":"CAN STUDENTS CUSTOMIZE THE PROGRAM?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"We decided to run the program on a cohort model, which means everyone takes the same computer science courses at the same time as the group they came in with.

A lot of students in this program don’t have a computer science background. If you didn’t get a computer science education as an undergraduate, you need to take some remedial catch-up courses. Our program includes two that you take at the outset of the program, followed by eight fundamental foundational courses.

You have to know it. Once you do, you don’t expect the machine to do the impossible. You know what it can do, what it can’t do, that it’s not a magic box. I teach students what a tortuous process the computer takes to add two numbers. When you learn that, you know what computers can do and cannot do in terms of network, parallelism, and creating a distributed system.

First, statistics skills help data scientists understand what kind of data they need to track and measure. In an MSDS statistical methods course, students learn to do the work of a statistician, which includes data collection and organization. Statistics is also necessary for data optimization. Once it’s clear what type of data that needs to be collected, a data scientist uses computer science skills to work with the technology that can organize or “clean” massive datasets quickly.

Finally, data scientists need business skills and domain expertise to turn their findings into strategic recommendations.","links":[],"bold":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Data scientist Ram Thilak offers another way to consider data science’s multidisciplinary nature: its history. Beginning in the 1950s, mathematicians, engineers, computer hobbyists and academics were researching the applications of computing technologies. At the same time, Thilak writes, industries were beginning to adopt management strategies that would make workflows more efficient — strategies that included data collection. These two areas of activity evolved separately through the decades as computer use spread and organizations leaned more heavily on statistics in decision making. With the creation of the internet, however, the disciplines merged. Business and “computer folks,” as Thilak calls them, came together with united interests, and modern data science was born.","links":[{"text":"its history","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-history-of-data-science-dfe789499d50"}],"bold":[]},{"type":"heading","level":2,"text":"The Rise of Unstructured Data"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The internet age brought us into the age of unstructured data.

The objective of this course is to give students a basic grounding in designing and implementing distributed and cloud systems, including issues in the implementation of backend services in the cloud itself. What are global consensus and Paxos, and what is their application in building cloud systems? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using distributed NoSQL stores such as Cassandra instead of relational stores such as MySQL? What are strong and weak consistency, what are the “CAP Theorem” and the “CALM Theorem” and what are their implications for building highly available services? What is a blockchain, such as the Bitcoin blockchain, and how does it relate to issues in coordinating distributed systems? What are the roles of REST, Websockets and stream processing in cloud applications? This course will combine hands-on experience in developing cloud services, with a firm grounding in the tools and principles for building distributed and cloud applications, including advanced architectures such as peer-to-peer and publish-subscribe. Besides cloud services, we will also be looking at cloud support for batch processing, such as the Hadoop framework, and its use with NoSQL data stores, such as Cassandra.</p>

Creating views, extracting trends, defining patterns, identifying clusters are all elements we need to manage large data. The field of data mining has evolved from the disciplines of statistics and artificial intelligence. This course will examine methods that have emerged from both fields and proven to be of value in recognizing patterns and making predictions from an applications perspective. Final goal of the course is to provide the students with a “data toolbox” they can use in their activities. This “toolbox” contains methods and tools that students will use themselves during the course for real world applications. The course is hand-on, but no coding is required, using Open Source Data Science tools that are based on Graphical User Interfaces.</p>
