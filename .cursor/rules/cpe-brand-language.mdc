# CPE Brand Language Rules

## Program Naming
- Programs are **Stevens programs**, NOT "CPE programs"
- CPE (College of Professional Education) is the operating hub/college, not a program brand
- Correct: "Stevens' online MBA", "our programs", "Stevens programs"
- Incorrect: "CPE programs", "CPE's MBA"

## When to Use "College of Professional Education" or "CPE"
- When referring to the college/institution itself: "The College of Professional Education at Stevens..."
- When describing the organizational entity: "CPE delivers flexible, market-driven learning..."
- When naming the hub: "Stevens College of Professional Education"

## SEO Titles
- Do NOT change existing SEO titles without explicit approval - they are based on SEO recommendations

## Brand Vocabulary (from approved Digital Pulp positioning)
- Key idea: "A bold new education designed for a fast-changing future"
- Use: market-driven, tech fluency, stackable credentials, employer-connected, future-focused
- Voice: Bold/future-facing, quietly confident, deeply pragmatic
- Avoid em dashes, use regular hyphens instead
