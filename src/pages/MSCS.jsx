Disconnected mobile computing challenges many of the assumptions underlying much of today’s distributed systems. “Cloud computing” provides a powerful background computing facility for mobile devices, but also raises important issues of trust and privacy. Many of these issues arise in critical yet sensitive domains such as electronic healthcare delivery. Mobile computing applications are location-aware or context-aware; the privacy implications of these applications are profound. Mobile, and increasingly location aware, gaming systems are now one of the largest sectors of the world entertainment industry. The purpose of this course is to review the fundamentals of mobile systems and applications, and how they relate to services in the cloud. The course will review material from wireless communication, distributed systems, and security and privacy, as they pertain to the systems being studied. The course will involve programming mobile apps using a popular mobile computing platform, such as Android or iPhone, to get hands-on experience with the concepts being discussed in the class.</p>

The objective of this course is to give students a basic grounding in designing and implementing distributed and cloud systems, including issues in the implementation of backend services in the cloud itself. What are global consensus and Paxos, and what is their application in building cloud systems? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using distributed NoSQL stores such as Cassandra instead of relational stores such as MySQL? What are strong and weak consistency, what are the “CAP Theorem” and the “CALM Theorem” and what are their implications for building highly available services? What is a blockchain, such as the Bitcoin blockchain, and how does it relate to issues in coordinating distributed systems? What are the roles of REST, Websockets and stream processing in cloud applications? This course will combine hands-on experience in developing cloud services, with a firm grounding in the tools and principles for building distributed and cloud applications, including advanced architectures such as peer-to-peer and publish-subscribe. Besides cloud services, we will also be looking at cloud support for batch processing, such as the Hadoop framework, and its use with NoSQL data stores, such as Cassandra.</p>

The course includes developing and deploying web and microservice applications in the cloud for both client-facing and B2B applications. The course also considers cloud support for enterprise integration and Internet of Things, and NoSQL data stores such as CosmosDB. Finally, the course considers virtualization and its role in the cloud, including security in virtualization. Cloud computing: SaaS and PaaS (e.g., Azure App Service). Web applications in the cloud: ASP.NET MVC. Enterprise Web services: gRPC and Web API. Serverless applications and microservices. Gathering and processing data using NoSQL data stores, e.g., CosmosDB. Enterprise blockchain: Azure Confidential Ledger and Quorum Blockchain Service. Virtualization as the basis for scalable enterprise and cloud computing: Xen, KVM, z/VM. Secure virtualization, e.g., Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux). Programming experience with Java or C# is required.</p>

                    <p class="text-stevens-sm text-stevens-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This course covers the issues in designing and engineering large enterprise and cloud-based software systems. Such systems are distributed and require increasingly complex inter-enterprise as well as intra-enterprise coordination. Technologies such as Web Services and cloud computing provide platforms for building such systems, and architectures such as microservices and cloud-native applications, event-driven architecture (EDA), domain-driven design (DDD), representational state transfer (REST), command query responsibility segregation (CQRS), serverless and blockchain are idioms for structuring such systems. Data modeling includes E-R designs, XML and JSON Schemas, NoSQL data models, semantic data modeling (OWL), and object-relational mapping (ORM). Process modeling includes BPMN, Workflow and Petri nets. The course includes hands-on application of the concepts with tools such as Jakarta EE and Eclipse MicroProfile, Docker, Kubernetes and Kafka, and Hyperledger Fabric. Knowledge of Java or C# is required.</p>

This course examines agile methods, including Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, Lean, Crystal, Dynamic Systems Development Method and Feature-Driven Development to understand how rapid realization of software occurs most effectively. The ability of agile development teams to rapidly develop high quality, customer-valued software is examined and contrasted with teams following more traditional methodologies that emphasize planning and documentation. Students will learn agile development principles and techniques covering the entire software development process from problem conception through development, testing and deployment, and will be able to effectively participate in and manage agile software developments as a result of their successfully completing this course. Case studies and software development projects are used throughout.</p>
