Creating views, extracting trends, defining patterns, identifying clusters are all elements we need to manage large data. The field of data mining has evolved from the disciplines of statistics and artificial intelligence. This course will examine methods that have emerged from both fields and proven to be of value in recognizing patterns and making predictions from an applications perspective. Final goal of the course is to provide the students with a “data toolbox” they can use in their activities. This “toolbox” contains methods and tools that students will use themselves during the course for real world applications.

                      <p class="text-stevens-sm text-stevens-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This course covers the theory and application of modeling aggregate demand, fragmented demand and consumer behavior using statistical methods for analysis and forecasting for facilities, services and products. It also aims to provide students with both the conceptual basis and tools necessary to conduct market segmentation studies, defining and identifying criteria for effective segmentation, along with techniques for simultaneous profiling of segments and models for dynamic segmentation. All of this provides a window on the external environment, thereby contributing input and context to product, process and systems design decisions and their ongoing management.</p>
