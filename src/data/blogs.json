More highly trained data scientists exist today than when LinkedIn reported in 2018 that 150,000 jobs for data scientists would go unfilled. The master’s has become the entry-level data science degree, and employers expect to see an MSDS on your resume as proof positive that you have the hard and soft skills to turn information into actionable insights. Bachelor’s degrees, boot camps, certificate programs and MOOC sequences are no longer sufficient to break into this field — especially now that innovations like Natural Language Processing, intelligent machines and Federated Learning are rapidly changing the data science landscape.",

You won’t just be handed them; this is a graduate program, so a lot of the learning is you-driven. Part of what you learn here is that being a computer scientist requires a lot of digging, a lot of looking online to figure out what has been done before, what works and what doesn’t.",

Additionally, many companies are willing to pay job candidates with both specialized engineering knowledge and advanced business expertise more than those with just one or the other, showcasing the significance of meeting engineering management requirements in the job market.Ultimately, what all engineering management graduates bring to the table are the leading-edge technical skills and knowledge they would not get in a purely business-focused program.

          "text": "Headlines declaring that data science is dead or data science will die soon — or that data scientists will become obsolete — ignore the fact that this discipline is evolving. It is only natural that interest in data science is skyrocketing. Innovations in neural networks, Natural Language Processing, intelligent machines, supervised learning and Federated Learning are relatively recent advancements in a discipline defined by disruptive technology. Data science was once a murky discipline that even those working in it could not easily define. Modern data science is growing more segmented and specialization makes it easier to see how data scientists in different roles deliver value. Some data scientists handle model development. Others do analysis. Still others adapt AI for technical implementation. And many data scientists specialize in software engineering, deep learning, data mining, data visualization or data architecture.",

In data science, success hinges on both. Ninety percent of data scientists have advanced degrees — suggesting a discipline with high respect for formal education — but a Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) isn’t enough to launch a career. Relationships drive opportunity and innovation, and building a robust professional network is equally as important as developing a knowledge base of technical data science skills. To optimize your journey towards success in this field, it is essential to choose the best data science program that caters to both academic excellence and networking opportunities.",

How do you create the hardware and software to do that? These are the kinds of problems you can solve as a computer scientist.

To me, there’s no difference between sitting in a live classroom and sitting on Zoom. I get to know students, I answer their questions in class and in meetings. Students are involved in a very interactive way even though they are not physically sitting in front of us.",

Get people to the floor they want to get to as fast as possible? Should it be first-come, first-served, or should we factor in the direction of the elevator? It’s a complex problem. You have to look at the pattern of movement of people, not just who is going where but how many people are waiting on each floor, and at what time. In the morning, there’s a lot of traffic from the lobby to offices. At noon, there’s a lot of traffic to and from the cafeteria. The algorithm has to become a learning machine, so now this lesson in algorithms also becomes a lesson in the importance of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It turns out this problem is NP-complete, so it’s not solvable in the way we might want to solve it. But we can solve it by learning from ants, looking at how they find food and bring it to their nest — which brings us back to learning from nature.

First, statistics skills help data scientists understand what kind of data they need to track and measure. In an MSDS statistical methods course, students learn to do the work of a statistician, which includes data collection and organization. Statistics is also necessary for data optimization. Once it’s clear what type of data that needs to be collected, a data scientist uses computer science skills to work with the technology that can organize or “clean” massive datasets quickly. This is where AI and machine learning technologies are useful. Finally, data scientists need business skills and domain expertise to turn their findings into strategic recommendations.",

Beginning in the 1950s, mathematicians, engineers, computer hobbyists and academics were researching the applications of computing technologies. At the same time, Thilak writes, industries were beginning to adopt management strategies that would make workflows more efficient — strategies that included data collection. These two areas of activity evolved separately through the decades as computer use spread and organizations leaned more heavily on statistics in decision making. With the creation of the internet, however, the disciplines merged. Business and “computer folks,” as Thilak calls them, came together with united interests, and modern data science was born.",
